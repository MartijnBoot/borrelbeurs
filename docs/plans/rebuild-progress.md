# Rebuild progress

Route: [rebuild-route.md](rebuild-route.md) · Loop: [ADR 0009](../adr/0009-autonomous-swarm-delivery.md)
Swarm state: CONTINUE
Updated: 2026-09-21 by swarm conversion (hand-written; the orchestrator owns it from here)

This file is the swarm's only memory. It is reconciled against git at the start of every run,
and written after **every** state transition — a run can die at any moment, and a transition
that is not written down did not happen.

## Now

Phase 0. In flight: nothing. Next ready: **T2**. Blocked on: nothing.

First run must, before dispatching T2:

1. Dispatch `fresh-eyes-reviewer` on `aaf1e3b..d6c10a9` — T1 merged with its review still
   outstanding under the old loop, and Gate C has never been satisfied for it. If it reports
   Correctness findings, they become a task in the plan rather than a silent fix.
2. Recompute the parallel groups below from the plan's own `Depends on` fields and correct them
   here if they disagree.

## Phases

## Phase 0 tasks

Plan: [phase-0-foundations.md](phase-0-foundations.md) · audited by the human, 2026-09-21.

Dependency graph as stated by the plan — **not serial**, despite what the old ledger said:

```
T1 ─► T2 ─► T3 ─┬─► T4 ─┐
                ├─► T5 ─► T6 ─┼─► T9 ─► T10 ─► T11 ─► T12
                └─► T7 ─┬─────┘
                        ├─► T8
                        └─► T13
```

| Group | Tasks | Note |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | T2 | |
| 2 | T3 | |
| 3 | T4, T5, T7 | three concurrent triads — exactly the cap |
| 4 | T6, T13 | |
| 5 | T8, T9 | T9 also needs T4 |
| 6 | T10 → T11 → T12 | serial tail |

| Task | State | Attempt | Branch | PR | Verified (command + actual output) | Review |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| T1 fresh repo | merged | 1 | `main` (founding commits `aaf1e3b`, `d6c10a9`) | none — pre-swarm | `git count-objects -vH` → size-pack 457.37 KiB < 5 MiB · largest blob after `docs/way-of-working.md` is 81.8 kB < 200 kB · `git log --all -- config/keys.json` → empty · `git log --all -- '*.tar'` → empty · all 32 imported blob hashes identical to v1 | **outstanding** — see Now, step 1 |
| T2 skeleton + pins + legacy move | ready | 0 | — | — | — | — |

## Decisions the swarm took alone

Carried forward from the pre-swarm loop, both taken during T1 with the human present:

- **2026-09-21, T1 — v1 repo renamed to free D14's chosen name.** D14 specifies `borrelbeurs`,
  but GitHub repo names are case-insensitive and the name was held by v1's own `BorrelBeurs`.
  v1 became `MartijnBoot/borrelbeurs-v1`; the new repo took `borrelbeurs`. The same collision
  hit the filesystem, so the new repo is cloned at `borrelbeurs-v2` locally. **Directory name ≠
  repo name; do not "fix" this.** R8 is unaffected — renaming does not rotate v1's keys, and
  Phase 8 still owns that.
- **2026-09-21, T1 — the new repo sets `core.autocrlf=false`.** v1 committed a mix of CRLF and
  LF; importing through a filter would have silently renormalised files. The import copied blob
  objects directly, so all 32 hashes match v1 byte for byte. T2's `.editorconfig` should treat
  line-ending normalisation as a deliberate, separate change — not something done incidentally
  during `git mv`.

## Open items the plan does not cover

- **No task asserts `.env.local` is gitignored**, yet T8 generates a real `JWT_SECRET` into it.
  T8 is not built yet. The swarm should fold this into T8's own verification rather than adding
  a task; if that is not possible, it is a plan amendment and needs `plan-auditor` to re-pass.

## Standing items, carried until closed

- The v1 access keys are still in the `borrelbeurs-v1` git history and need rotating. Phase 8
  AC17 owns it. **Hard stop when reached** — it needs a human with account access.
- `CLAUDE.md` still says "Don't introduce a database"; this rebuild reverses that. T13 fixes it
  in this repo; Phase 8 cutover confirms it.

## Blocked — needs a human

None.
